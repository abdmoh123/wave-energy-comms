# LoRa transmission and reception simulator

> By Abdul Hawisa

Simulates how data can be transmitted and received wirelessly through LoRa.
This includes adding the effects of interference through transmission.

Here is a simple diagram illustrating how the system would work:

LoRa uses CSS (Chip Spread Spectrum) to modulate data, which involves generating upchirps and symbols to represent the data.
This allows signals to be transmitted at a long range with minimal loss in quality, however, the drawback is the lower transmission data rate.
